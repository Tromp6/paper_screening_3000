---

## 📋 **Main Commands**

### **Start New Review**
```bash
# Basic usage - processes all 8 strategic queries
python systematic_review.py

# Limit papers per query (faster testing)
python systematic_review.py --max-results 10

# Start from specific query (resume capability)
python systematic_review.py --start-from 3
```

### **Manual Screening Options**
```bash
# Review AI decisions for existing run
python systematic_review.py --manual-screen --run review_run_20250605_140652

# When prompted, choose:
# 1 = Review only AI-included papers (recommended - efficient)
# 2 = Review only AI-rejected papers (check false negatives)  
# 3 = Review both included and rejected papers (comprehensive)
# 5 = Accept all AI decisions automatically
```

### **Import and Results**
```bash
# Import final approved papers to Zotero
python systematic_review.py --import-to-zotero --run review_run_20250605_140652

# View detailed statistics
python systematic_review.py --view-results --run review_run_20250605_140652

# Generate combined PRISMA report
python systematic_review.py --generate-report --run review_run_20250605_140652
```

### **🔄 Dynamic Query Management**

**One of the key advantages of this platform** - you can easily add or remove queries from an existing review and regenerate accurate reports!

```bash
# Add a new query to existing review
# 1. Update queries_config.json with new query (e.g., query #9)
# 2. Run only the new query
python systematic_review.py --start-from 9 --run review_run_20250605_140652

# 3. Regenerate complete report with all queries (including new one)
python systematic_review.py --generate-report --run review_run_20250605_140652

# Remove a query from existing review  
# 1. Delete the query folder
rm -rf systematic_review_results/review_run_20250605_140652/01_individual_queries/screening/query_03/

# 2. Regenerate report without that query
python systematic_review.py --generate-report --run review_run_20250605_140652
```

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ **Late-stage deduplication** - conflicts resolved at report generation
- ✅ **Dynamic query detection** - system automatically finds all existing queries  
- ✅ **Fresh calculations** - statistics and counts updated correctly
- ✅ **Conflict resolution** - handles duplicates between old and new queries
- ✅ **No re-screening required** - preserves all existing work

**Perfect for iterative research** where you discover new search terms or need to refine your scope!

    ├── README.md                         # Run documentation
    ├── 01_individual_queries/            # Query-by-query results
    │   ├── papers/query_01/              # Papers from each query

## 🔧 **Configuration**

### **API Keys Setup**

Create `.env` file:
```bash
# OpenAI API (required for AI screening)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# Zotero API (optional - for automatic import)
ZOT_USER_ID=your_zotero_user_id
ZOT_KEY=your_zotero_api_key
COLL_OA=your_zotero_collection_id
```

### **Customizing Search Queries**

**🔧 All search queries are defined in `queries_config.json`** - you must customize this file for your research topic!

The default configuration is optimized for **LLM security research**, but you can easily adapt it for any systematic review topic.

#### **Query Structure**
```json
{
  "strategic_queries": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "query": "\"jailbreak\" AND \"large language model\"",
      "description": "Direct jailbreak techniques for LLMs", 
      "category": "attack",
      "expected_focus": "Core jailbreak methodologies and prompt-based exploits"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "query": "\"prompt injection\" AND \"machine learning\"",
      "description": "Prompt injection vulnerabilities",
      "category": "attack", 
      "expected_focus": "Input validation bypass techniques"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### **Key Configuration Options**

**Time Range:**
```json
"timeframe": {
  "start_date": "2022-01-01",    // Adjust for your field's relevant period
  "end_date": "2025-01-01"       // Current date boundary
}
```

**Quality Filters:**
```json
"quality_criteria": {
  "min_citations": 5,            // Higher for mature fields, lower for emerging topics
  "peer_reviewed_only": true,    // Set false to include preprints
  "exclude_preprints": true      // Set false for cutting-edge research
}
```

#### **Example: Medical Research Configuration**
```json
{
  "search_strategy": {
    "version": "v1.0_medical_intervention",
    "description": "Systematic review of telemedicine interventions",
    "timeframe": {
      "start_date": "2020-01-01",
      "end_date": "2025-01-01"
    }
  },
  "strategic_queries": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "query": "\"telemedicine\" AND \"patient outcomes\"",
      "description": "Telemedicine effectiveness studies",
      "category": "intervention",
      "expected_focus": "Clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction"
    },
    {
      "id": 2, 
      "query": "\"remote consultation\" AND \"healthcare quality\"",
      "description": "Quality of remote healthcare delivery",
      "category": "quality",
      "expected_focus": "Healthcare delivery standards and metrics"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### **Tips for Effective Query Design**

**✅ Best Practices:**
- Use 3-8 strategic queries (not too few, not overwhelming)
- Combine specific terms with broader concepts: `"blockchain" AND "supply chain"`
- Use quotes for exact phrases: `"machine learning"`
- Balance breadth vs precision based on your field's maturity

**❌ Common Pitfalls:**
- Don't use overly complex Boolean logic (AI screening compensates for broad queries)
- Avoid queries that are too narrow (might miss relevant papers)
- Don't duplicate concepts across queries (creates unnecessary overlap)

**🎯 The platform handles deduplication automatically**, so slightly overlapping queries are fine!

### **Search Configuration**

The system uses 8 strategic queries optimized for LLM security research (defined in `queries_config.json`):

**Attack Techniques (3 queries):**
- `"jailbreak" AND "large language model"`
- `"prompt injection" AND "large language model"`  
- `"adversarial prompt" AND "large language model"`

**Defense Strategies (5 queries):**
- `"defend" AND "jailbreak"`
- `"prompt injection defense"`
- `"defense mechanism" AND "language model"`
- `"jailbreak detection"`
- `"security framework" AND "language model"`

**Search Period:** 2022-2025 (modern LLM era)  
**Quality Filter:** 5+ citations for impact assessment
